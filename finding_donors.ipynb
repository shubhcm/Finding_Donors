    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "\n",
    "** Support Vector Machines ** <br>\n",
    "Since this is a classification problem, SVM seems to be a fit classifier. SVM does supervised classification.<br>\n",
    "1. Application : SVM has many real world examples. It is used in classification of images. It can be used for classification of faces, as face-objects and non-face-objects in an image. Other application is Text and Hypertext categorization. For example, classification of news feed into \"business\" and \"movies\". Another good example of SVM is handwriting recognition, which can be used for validating signatures on documents.\n",
    "2. Strenths : SVM support kernels, like rbf and quadratic which can be used for polynomial classification. SVM uses maximisation of margin, because of which it is slightly more robust than regression models. Also, training of data is fast in SVM(for not very large dataset). Good for feature intense data.\n",
    "3. Weakness : Choice of kernels can be a tricky thing. They dont perform well with very large dataset because training time happens to be cubic of the size of dataset.They dont work well with lots and lots of noise(prone to overfit the noise).\n",
    "4. The model can still be a good candidate as there seems to be some features in the data that can more clearly define the income level boundary.<br>\n",

    "** GaussianNB **<br>\n",
    "1. Application : Classifying an incoming mail as spam or not. Used by google. Used in sentiment analysis for classifing text as positive or negative. \n",
    "2. Strength : Simple to run, easy to implement and efficient with large data sets. Also able to handle datasets with many features, say 20k of 200k features. \n",
    "3. Weakness : It breaks sometimes. It is not good at handling phrases made of multiple words. For eg - initially when google introduced it, people searched for chicago bulls, and the output of that search result were a bunch of pictures of bulls as well as pictures of cities like chicago.\n",
    "4. Used because our data set has many  features, 103 to be precise. This model can prove to be handy here. <br>\n",

    "1. Application : Speech recognition (accented speeches)\n",
    "2. Strengths : Simple to understand and interpret. Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. It generally uses less data preprocessing as compared to other classifiers. Also, it happens to imitate human thinking more closely than any other classifier.\n",
    "3. Weakness : Sometimes, trees do not tend to be accurate, like other classifiers. Trees can be very non-robust. A small change in training data can result in big change in the tree. Overfitting is another problem, as was shown in the course lectures.\n",
    "4. For this data set the decision tree model will perform well because we have a large and clean dataset of binary labels. <br>\n",

In other words, it isn't very concerned with people who are comfortably passing or failing, but rather what the differences are between students who have only just passed, or only just failed. It will try to establish this boundary between marginal students as clearly as possible, thus enabling it to figure out what the most important factors are in getting students to pass.\n",
    "Using knowledge about the data - for example, age, gender, family size, points (these are called features) we first plot them to establish relationships:\n",
    "Data Points\n",
    "For this drawing, the green dots are passed students, and the red ones are failed students. The SVM algorithm then draws a boundary to try and seperate the passed students from the failed students:\n",
    "Data Points + Boundary\n",
    "We can see several plausable boundary lines here - but the objective of the SVM algorithm is to find the line with the maximum margin (solid line) and select that over a sub-optimal boundary (dashed lines). By maximising the margin, we make the model as 'safe' as possible from error i.e. reduce passed students being mixed with failed and vice versa.\n",
    "In reality, the data points are typically structured in much more complex ways, as with our student data. We have to consider several features at once, and the relationships aren't so linear anymore:\n",
    "Complex Data + Boundary\n",
    "Here we can clearly see a curve or some other complex structure is required to seperate the data. This means we have to do more than the basic SVM model and extend the functionality. We achieve this by using mathematical functions, called 'kernels'. What a kernel does is basically transform data points into a new dimension so that they can be seperable[7]:\n",
    "Kernel Trick 1Kernel Trick 2\n",
    "Here, the green points in particular are focused on and shifted onto a seperate dimension. By then drawing a boundary across this dimension, the complex structure is now easily seperable by a linear boundary.\n",
    "Once the boundary has been established, the model can use it to predict whether a student is going to pass or fail, depending on what side of the boundary a new data point is on.<br>\n",

In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset."

    "When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?"

    "5) age <br>\n",

    "First of all, capital gain can tell about the earnings of an individual. <br>\n",
    "Then comes capital-loss, which tells about the current financial situation of a person about the amount of debts that person owes, or the losses he/she has suffered recently, which can directly be related to his or her donation capabilities.<br>\n",
    "Education_num tells about the qualification of the person, and from this feature we can often generalize the fact that, more educated the person is, more money he or she makes.<br>\n",
    "Occupation also is one of the most important features because there are certain occupations which pay more that some other. Hence, it directly effects the capital gain feature which we discussed above.<br>\n",
    "More age of a person may be directly linked to the amount of money they make, in most of the cases. Older people earn more than younger people"

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
